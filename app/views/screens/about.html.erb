<p> 
Bala Balachandran began his teaching career in 1960 while a graduate student at Annamalai University, India. In 1967 he moved to the University of Dayton and   in   1971, to   Carnegie-Mellon   University, Pittsburgh, where he taught Management courses while working on his doctorate. In 1973 he joined the Kellogg Graduate School of Management faculty. From 1979 to 1983 he chaired the Department of Accounting  and  Information   Systems;  in 1984 he  was appointed Distinguished  Professor of Accounting  and  Information  Systems  and Decision  Sciences. He was also Director of the Accounting Research Center until 2006.<br>
He has the rare honor (for an Indian in America) of having an endowed chair professorship in his name.  Several colleagues from Kellogg, including Donald P. Jacobs (Kellogg Dean Emeritus), Roger Nelson (retired Deputy Chairman for Ernst & Young), and Harry Kraemer Jr. (former Chairman and CEO of Baxter), have led a campaign to raise $1 million for an endowed professorship at the Kellogg School of Management in Prof. Bala V. Balachandran’s name in recognition of his invaluable and tireless service to the institute over the last three decades.</p>

</div>
<p> 
As a visionary who aspires to transform the conventional educational practices and infuse technology into school education, Mr Shantanu Prakash is extremely passionate about improving the “quality of education” and “access to education”, two things, he feels, that are essential to improving the education system in the country. “Before we do anything else, we need to have those kids inside the school,” he says emphatically. His ideas took wings when he got his first opportunity to work closely with the Central Government and the State Governments to set up computer labs in schools. His passion to employ innovative practices in education prompted him to equip private schools, too, with digital education. As an expert in instructional technology, he has worked extensively in the domain of education management, multimedia content and instructional delivery for almost two decades now.<br>
Mr Shantanu Prakash’s entrepreneurial skills have changed the face of Indian education, bringing an altogether new dimension to the conventional teaching–learning process. Educomp boasts of several innovations in educational technology under his leadership. The most recognized ones are smartclassTM, QuestTM, MathguruTM, WIZiQTM, Learn HubTM, LeapTM, and MagickeysTM. Educomp also operates through its various collaterals such as authorGEN, ThreeBriX eServices, Learning.com, USA, AsknLearn and Singapore Learning. </p>
